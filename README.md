Not all sensors of this driver family support all measurements.
In case a measurement is not supported by all sensors, the products that
support it are listed in the API description.



The default IÂ²C address of [SPS30](https://sensirion.com/products/catalog/SPS30) is **0x69**.



## Connect the sensor

You can connect your sensor over a [SEK-SensorBridge](https://developer.sensirion.com/product-support/sek-sensorbridge/).
For special setups you find the sensor pinout in the section below.
